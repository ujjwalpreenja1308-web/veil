## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does the Composio + Slack integration do?

Composio turns Slack's API into ready-to-use tools that AI agents and automations can call. With the integration you can send and read messages, manage channels, upload files, react to events, search conversations, and more — all through a unified platform. Composio supports two toolkits: **Slack** (authenticate as a user for workspace-level actions) and **Slackbot** (authenticate as a bot for in-channel messaging, app mentions, and slash commands). Developers connect their Slack workspace once and then orchestrate any combination of these actions from their agents or workflows.

### How does Composio handle my Slack data?

Composio executes API calls on behalf of your connected account. All data is encrypted and subject to a 30-day retention policy. Authentication tokens are encrypted at rest and scoped to the permissions you grant during the OAuth flow. For full details on data handling, retention, and third-party data practices, see our [Privacy Policy](https://composio.dev/privacy).

### How do I set up custom OAuth credentials for Slack?

For a step-by-step guide on creating and configuring your own Slack OAuth credentials with Composio, see [How to create OAuth credentials for Slack](https://composio.dev/auth/slack).

### What is the difference between Slack and Slackbot toolkits?

Slack is for workspace-level API access (channels, files, users) while Slackbot is bot-centric (messaging, interactivity). Slack triggers cover workspace events; Slackbot covers bot entry points like app mentions, DMs, and slash commands. Slack can post as the app; Slackbot posts as the bot user.

### Where can I find Slack's available scopes?

See the [Slack scopes reference](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes/).

### Why am I getting a redirect URI mismatch error?

Update the redirect URL in your Slack App under OAuth & Permissions → Redirect URLs.

### How do I set up Slack event webhooks?

Enable Event Subscriptions in your Slack app. Set the Request URL to `https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3/trigger_instances/slack/default/handle`. Add events (e.g., `reaction_added`) to Subscribe to Bot Events and save. If using the Slackbot integration, add the bot to the channels you want to monitor.

### Why am I getting scope errors on Slack?

Either you're missing a bot scope (add one under OAuth & Permissions) or you have "Insufficient scopes" (ensure all scopes from your auth config are configured in the Slack app).

### What does the `as_user` parameter do in Slack tools?

For the Slack toolkit, set `as_user=True` to post as the authenticated user. For Slackbot, leave it blank (defaults to false). A `missing_charset` error usually means invalid `as_user`, wrong channel ID, or missing required fields.

### Why aren't my Slack triggers working?

Provide the Verification Token or signing secret in the auth config so Composio can validate incoming events.

### Fetch conversation history

**Slug:** `SLACK_FETCH_CONVERSATION_HISTORY`

Fetches a chronological list of messages and events from a specified Slack conversation, accessible by the authenticated user/bot, with options for pagination and time range filtering. IMPORTANT LIMITATION: This action only returns messages from the main channel timeline. Threaded replies are NOT returned by this endpoint. To retrieve threaded replies, use the SLACK_FETCH_MESSAGE_THREAD_FROM_A_CONVERSATION action (conversations.replies API) instead. The oldest/latest timestamp filters work reliably for filtering the main channel timeline, but cannot be used to retrieve individual threaded replies - even if you know the exact reply timestamp, setting oldest=latest to that timestamp will return an empty messages array. To get threaded replies: 1. Use this action to get parent messages (which include thread_ts, reply_count, latest_reply fields) 2. Use SLACK_FETCH_MESSAGE_THREAD_FROM_A_CONVERSATION with the parent's thread_ts to fetch all replies in that thread

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `limit` | integer | No | Maximum number of messages to return (1-1000). The action automatically paginates through API requests to fetch the requested number of messages. Note: Per-request API limits vary by app type (Marketplace/internal apps: up to 999 per request; non-Marketplace apps: 15 per request as of May 2025). Recommended: 200 or fewer for optimal performance. |
| `cursor` | string | No | Pagination cursor from `next_cursor` of a previous response to fetch subsequent pages. See Slack's pagination documentation for details. |
| `latest` | string | No | End of the time range of messages to include in results. Accepts a Unix timestamp or a Slack timestamp (e.g., '1234567890.000000'). NOTE: This filter only applies to main channel messages, not threaded replies. Use SLACK_FETCH_MESSAGE_THREAD_FROM_A_CONVERSATION to retrieve replies. |
| `oldest` | string | No | Start of the time range of messages to include in results. Accepts a Unix timestamp or a Slack timestamp (e.g., '1234567890.000000'). NOTE: This filter only applies to main channel messages, not threaded replies. Use SLACK_FETCH_MESSAGE_THREAD_FROM_A_CONVERSATION to retrieve replies. |
| `channel` | string | Yes | The ID of the public channel, private channel, direct message, or multi-person direct message to fetch history from. |
| `inclusive` | boolean | No | When true, includes messages at the exact 'oldest' or 'latest' boundary timestamps in results. When false (default), excludes boundary messages. Only applies when 'oldest' or 'latest' is specified. |
| `include_all_metadata` | boolean | No | Return all metadata associated with messages in the conversation history. When true, includes additional metadata fields that may be present on messages. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `data` | object | Yes | Data from the action execution |
| `error` | string | No | Error if any occurred during the execution of the action |
| `successful` | boolean | Yes | Whether or not the action execution was successful or not |

### Fetch item reactions

**Slug:** `SLACK_FETCH_ITEM_REACTIONS`

Fetches reactions for a Slack message, file, or file comment. Exactly one identifier path must be provided: `channel`+`timestamp`, `file`, or `file_comment`. Mixing identifiers (e.g., providing both `channel`+`timestamp` and `file`) causes errors. If the response omits the `reactions` field, the item has zero reactions.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `file` | string | No | File ID. Use instead of channel/timestamp or file comment ID. |
| `full` | boolean | No | If true, returns the complete list of users for each reaction. |
| `channel` | string | No | Channel ID. Required if `timestamp` is provided and no file or file comment ID is given. |
| `team_id` | string | No | Required if using an org-level token. The team/workspace ID where the item exists. Ignored if using a workspace-level token. |
| `timestamp` | string | No | Message timestamp (e.g., '1234567890.123456'). Required if `channel` is provided and no file or file comment ID is given. Thread reply timestamps are tracked separately from the parent message; use the reply's own timestamp to fetch its reactions. |
| `file_comment` | string | No | File comment ID. Use instead of channel/timestamp or file ID. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `data` | object | Yes | Data from the action execution |
| `error` | string | No | Error if any occurred during the execution of the action |
| `successful` | boolean | Yes | Whether or not the action execution was successful or not |

### Retrieve conversation replies

**Slug:** `SLACK_FETCH_MESSAGE_THREAD_FROM_A_CONVERSATION`

Retrieves replies to a specific parent message in a Slack conversation, using the channel ID and the parent message's timestamp (`ts`). Note: The parent message in the response contains metadata (reply_count, reply_users, latest_reply) that indicates expected thread activity. If the returned messages array contains fewer replies than reply_count indicates, check: (1) has_more=true means pagination is needed, (2) recently posted replies may have timing delays, (3) some replies may be filtered by permissions or deleted. The composio_execution_message field will warn about any detected mismatches.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ts` | string | No | Timestamp of the parent message in the thread. Must be an existing message. If no replies, only the parent message itself is returned. Must be the exact full timestamp string of the root/parent message — not a reply's ts, a truncated value, a permalink, or an integer; these silently return wrong results. |
| `limit` | integer | No | Maximum number of messages to return. Fewer may be returned even if more are available. |
| `cursor` | string | No | Pagination cursor from `response_metadata.next_cursor` of a previous response to get subsequent pages. If omitted, fetches the first page. |
| `latest` | string | No | Latest message timestamp in the time range to include results. |
| `oldest` | string | No | Oldest message timestamp in the time range to include results. Must be a UTC-based Slack ts string; incorrect timezone conversion or rounding can produce empty result windows. |
| `channel` | string | No | ID of the conversation (channel, direct message, etc.) to fetch the thread from. Must be a channel ID, not a channel name. Token must have membership in private channels or DMs, otherwise returns empty results or `not_in_channel`/`channel_not_found`. |
| `team_id` | string | No | Required for org-wide apps: the workspace ID to use for this request. If using a workspace-level token, this parameter is optional and will be ignored. |
| `inclusive` | boolean | No | Whether to include messages with `latest` or `oldest` timestamps in results. Effective only if `latest` or `oldest` is specified. |
| `include_all_metadata` | boolean | No | Return all metadata associated with messages in the thread. When true, includes additional metadata fields that may be present on messages. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `data` | object | Yes | Data from the action execution |
| `error` | string | No | Error if any occurred during the execution of the action |

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `team` | string | No | The ID of the team to retrieve information for. If omitted, information for the current team (associated with the authentication token) is returned. The token must have permissions to view the specified team, especially for teams accessible via external shared channels. |
| `domain` | string | No | Query by domain instead of team (only when team is null). This only works for domains in the same enterprise as the querying team token. This also expects the domain to belong to a team and not the enterprise itself. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `data` | string | Yes | Data from the action execution |
| `error` | string | No | Error if any occurred during the execution of the action |
| `successful` | boolean | Yes | Whether or not the action execution was successful or not |

### Find channels

**Slug:** `SLACK_FIND_CHANNELS`

Find channels in a Slack workspace by any criteria - name, topic, purpose, or description. Returns channel IDs (C*/G* prefixed) required by most Slack tools — always resolve names to IDs here before passing to other tools. NOTE: This action can only search channels visible to the bot. Empty results may indicate: - No channels match the search query in name, topic, or purpose - The target channel is private and the bot hasn't been invited - The bot lacks required scopes (channels:read, groups:read). If empty, retry with exact_match=false or exclude_archived=false to avoid false negatives. In large workspaces, paginate using next_cursor to avoid missing matches. Check 'composio_execution_message' and 'total_channels_searched' in the response for details.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `limit` | integer | No | Maximum number of channels to return (1 to 999). Defaults to 50. Slack recommends no more than 200 results at a time for optimal performance. |

| `types` | string | No | Comma-separated list of channel types to include: `public_channel`, `private_channel`, `mpim` (multi-person direct message), `im` (direct message). Defaults to public and private channels. |
| `team_id` | string | No | The ID of the workspace to list channels from. Required when using an org-level token to specify which workspace to retrieve channels from. This field is ignored when using a workspace-level token. |
| `exact_match` | boolean | No | When true, only return channels whose name exactly matches the query (case-insensitive). Also matches against previous channel names and the 'general' flag. When false, returns partial matches across name, topic, and purpose. Defaults to false. |
| `member_only` | boolean | No | Only return channels the user is a member of. Defaults to false. |
| `exclude_archived` | boolean | No | Exclude archived channels from search results. Defaults to true. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

### Lookup users by email (Deprecated)

**Slug:** `SLACK_FIND_USER_BY_EMAIL_ADDRESS`

DEPRECATED: Use FindUsers instead. Retrieves the Slack user object for an active user by their registered email address; requires the users:read.email OAuth scope. Fails with 'users_not_found' if the email is unregistered, the user is inactive, the account is a guest, or the email is hidden by workspace privacy settings.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `email` | string | Yes | The email address of the user to look up. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

### Find users

**Slug:** `SLACK_FIND_USERS`

Find users in a Slack workspace by any criteria - email, name, display name, or other text. Includes optimized email lookup for exact email matches. Zero results may reflect email visibility restrictions or workspace policies, not global absence. Repeated calls may trigger HTTP 429; honor the Retry-After header.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `email` | string | No | Email address to search for. This is a convenience parameter that automatically performs an email-based search. Either email or search_query parameter is required. |
| `limit` | integer | No | Maximum number of users to return (1 to 1000). Slack recommends no more than 200 for optimal performance. Defaults to 50. Large workspaces may require pagination or repeated queries to cover all users. |
| `team_id` | string | No | The ID of the Slack workspace (e.g., 'T123456789'). Required when using an org-level token. For workspace-level tokens, this is optional and will be ignored. |
| `exact_match` | boolean | No | When true, only returns users with exact matches on name, display name, real name, first name, last name, or email fields (case-insensitive). For email queries, uses Slack's dedicated email lookup endpoint. When false, allows partial/substring matching. Defaults to false. |
| `include_bots` | boolean | No | Include bot users in search results. Defaults to false. |
| `search_query` | string | No | Search query to find users. Can be a Slack user ID (e.g., 'U012ABCDEF'), email address, or name. For user IDs (starting with 'U' or 'W'), uses Slack's users.info API directly. For email addresses with exact_match=true, uses Slack's email lookup endpoint. For other queries, searches across name, display name, real name, email, first name, last name, and status text (case-insensitive partial matching). Either search_query (or 'query' as alias), or email parameter is required. Name-based queries can return multiple matches — verify exactly one user ID before passing to downstream tools like SLACK_OPEN_DM or SLACK_SEND_MESSAGE; disambiguate using email or real_name fields. |
| `include_locale` | boolean | No | Include the `locale` field for each user. Defaults to `false`. |
| `include_deleted` | boolean | No | Include deleted/deactivated users in search results. Defaults to false. |

Retrieves a paginated list of all users with profile details, status, and team memberships in a Slack workspace; data may not be real-time. Filter response fields `is_bot`, `is_app_user`, and `deleted` to build human-only rosters. Profile fields like `email` and `phone` may be absent depending on OAuth scopes and workspace privacy settings. Guest/restricted accounts may be omitted based on scopes—do not treat results as a complete directory. High-frequency calls risk HTTP 429; honor the `Retry-After` header and throttle to ~1–2 requests/second. Use stable user IDs rather than display names for mapping. Prefer SLACK_FIND_USERS for targeted lookups; cache results to avoid full-workspace fetches.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `limit` | integer | No | Maximum number of items to return per page; fewer may be returned if the end of the list is reached. Recommended to set a value (e.g., 100) as Slack may error for large workspaces if omitted. |
| `cursor` | string | No | Pagination cursor for fetching subsequent pages. Set to `next_cursor` from a previous response's `response_metadata`. Omit for the first page. Paginate until `next_cursor` is empty—stopping early silently undercounts users. Page size is capped at ~200 users. |
| `team_id` | string | No | The workspace/team ID to list users from. Required when using an org-level token (Enterprise Grid). This field is ignored when using a workspace-level token. Use admin.teams.list to get available team IDs. |

### List Slack Canvases (Deprecated)

**Slug:** `SLACK_LIST_CANVASES`

DEPRECATED: Use SLACK_LIST_FILES_WITH_FILTERS_IN_SLACK instead (pass types="canvas" for equivalent behavior). Lists Slack Canvases with filtering by channel, user, timestamp, and page-based pagination. Uses Slack's files.list API with types=canvas filter. Only canvases accessible to the authenticated app are returned; missing canvases indicate permissions restrictions, not empty data. Use `paging.pages` in the response to determine total pages; iterate `page` with `count` to retrieve all results. Known limitations: - The 'user' filter may return canvases accessible to the specified user, not just canvases they created. - The 'ts_from' and 'ts_to' timestamp filters may not work reliably for canvas types. Consider client-side filtering on the 'created' field in the response if precise date filtering is required.

#### Input Parameters

| `count` | integer | No | Maximum number of canvases to return per page (1-1000) |
| `ts_to` | integer | No | Filter canvases created before this Unix timestamp (inclusive). Pass as integer epoch seconds. Note: This filter may not work reliably for canvas types in the Slack API. |
| `channel` | string | No | Optional channel ID (e.g., 'C1234567890') to filter canvases. Must be a channel ID, not name. |
| `team_id` | string | No | Team/Workspace ID for Enterprise Grid organizations (starts with 'T'). Required when using org-level tokens. For single-workspace installations, this parameter is optional and will be ignored. |
| `ts_from` | integer | No | Filter canvases created after this Unix timestamp (inclusive). Pass as integer epoch seconds. Note: This filter may not work reliably for canvas types in the Slack API. |
| `show_files_hidden_by_limit` | boolean | No | Display truncated file metadata for older files when workspace has exceeded file limits. When true, shows metadata for files that would normally be hidden due to workspace storage limits. |

List conversations (channels/DMs) accessible to a specified user (or the authenticated user if no user ID is provided), respecting shared membership for non-public channels. Returns conversation IDs (C* for channels, G* for group DMs), not display names. Absence of private channels, DMs, or MPIMs from results indicates token scope or membership limits, not that the conversation is nonexistent.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `user` | string | No | The ID of the user whose conversations will be listed. If not provided, conversations for the authenticated user are returned. Non-public channels are restricted to those where the calling user (authenticating user) shares membership. |
| `limit` | integer | No | The maximum number of items to return per page. Must be an integer, typically between 1 and 1000 (e.g., 100). If omitted, the API's default limit (often 100) applies. Fewer items than the limit may be returned. |
| `types` | string | No | Comma-separated list of conversation types to include: `public_channel` (regular #channels everyone can join), `private_channel` (invite-only channels), `im` (1-on-1 direct messages), `mpim` (group direct messages with 3+ people). If omitted, all types are included. If omitted, the API defaults to `public_channel` only — explicitly specify all desired types to include private channels, DMs, or MPIMs. For `im` results, only user IDs are returned; use a user-lookup tool to resolve display names. |
| `cursor` | string | No | Pagination cursor for retrieving the next set of results. Obtain this from the `next_cursor` field in a previous response's `response_metadata`. If omitted, the first page is fetched. Must loop on `next_cursor` until it is empty to avoid silently missing conversations. |
| `team_id` | string | No | The team (workspace) ID to filter conversations by. Required for Enterprise Grid tokens to specify which workspace. Can be obtained from team.info API. |
| `exclude_archived` | boolean | No | Set to `true` to exclude archived channels from the list. If `false` or omitted, archived channels are typically included (the API's default behavior for omission will apply, usually including them). |

**Slug:** `SLACK_RETRIEVE_CONVERSATION_INFORMATION`

Retrieves metadata for a Slack conversation by ID (e.g., name, purpose, creation date, with options for member count/locale), excluding message content. The `channel` parameter is effectively required. Private channels, DMs, or channels where the app lacks membership may return restricted data; check `is_archived` and `is_member` fields in the response to diagnose access issues.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `limit` | integer | No | The maximum number of members to return per page. Fewer items may be returned than the requested limit, even if more members exist and the end of the list hasn't been reached. |
| `cursor` | string | No | Pagination cursor value for fetching specific pages of results. To retrieve the next page, provide the `next_cursor` value obtained from the `response_metadata` of the previous API call. If omitted or empty, the first page of members is fetched. For more details on pagination, refer to Slack API documentation. Loop by passing `next_cursor` into subsequent calls until `next_cursor` is empty to avoid silently truncating large member lists. |
| `channel` | string | No | ID of the conversation (public channel, private channel, direct message, or multi-person direct message) for which to retrieve the member list. Public channel IDs typically start with 'C', private channels or multi-person direct messages (MPIMs) with 'G', and direct messages (DMs) with 'D'. Channel names are NOT accepted — only IDs. Obtain IDs via SLACK_FIND_CHANNELS or SLACK_LIST_CONVERSATIONS. For private channels and MPIMs, the app must have required scopes and be a member of the conversation, otherwise members may not be returned. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `data` | object | Yes | Data from the action execution |
| `error` | string | No | Error if any occurred during the execution of the action |

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | No | This sends raw text only, use markdown_text field for formatting. Primary text of the message; formatting with `mrkdwn` applies. Required if `blocks` and `attachments` are not provided. |
| `parse` | string | No | Message text treatment: `full` for special formatting, `none` otherwise (default). See Slack's `chat.postMessage` docs for options. |
| `blocks` | string | No | **DEPRECATED**: Use `markdown_text` field instead. JSON array of structured blocks as a URL-encoded string for message layout and design. Required if `text` and `attachments` are not provided. |
| `channel` | string | No | Channel, private group, or DM channel ID (e.g., C1234567890) or name (e.g., #general) to send the message to. Bot must be a member of the target channel; missing membership returns `not_in_channel` error. |
| `post_at` | string | No | Unix EPOCH timestamp (integer seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) for the future message send time. Must be strictly greater than current time (past values return `time_in_past` error). Always convert local times to UTC epoch seconds before use; Slack evaluates in UTC only. |
| `team_id` | string | No | Team ID for Enterprise Grid workspaces. Required for orgs with multiple workspaces. |
| `thread_ts` | string | No | Timestamp of the parent message for the scheduled message to be a thread reply. Must be float seconds (e.g., `1234567890.123456`). |
| `link_names` | boolean | No | Pass true to automatically link channel names (e.g., #general) and usernames (e.g., @user). NOTE: This parameter is deprecated by Slack; the linking behavior is primarily controlled by Slack's default message parsing. For explicit control, use the 'parse' parameter instead (set to 'full' to enable auto-linking). |
| `attachments` | string | No | This is Slack's legacy 'secondary attachments' field for adding rich formatting elements like colored sidebars, structured fields, and author info. Pass as a JSON string array. NOT for file/image uploads. To send files or images, use 'SLACK_UPLOAD_OR_CREATE_A_FILE_IN_SLACK' instead. |
| `unfurl_links` | boolean | No | Pass false to disable automatic link unfurling. Defaults to true. NOTE: Due to a known Slack API limitation, this parameter may not be respected for scheduled messages (works correctly for chat.postMessage but may be ignored by chat.scheduleMessage). |
| `unfurl_media` | boolean | No | Pass false to disable automatic media unfurling. Defaults to true. NOTE: Due to a known Slack API limitation, this parameter may not be respected for scheduled messages (works correctly for chat.postMessage but may be ignored by chat.scheduleMessage). |
| `markdown_text` | string | No | **PREFERRED**: Write your scheduled message in markdown for nicely formatted display. Supports headers (#), bold (**text**), italic (*text*), strikethrough (~~text~~), code (```), links ([text](url)), quotes (>), and dividers (---). Your message will be posted with beautiful formatting. |
| `reply_broadcast` | boolean | No | With `thread_ts`, makes reply visible to all in channel, not just thread members. Defaults to `false`. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `data` | object | Yes | Data from the action execution |
| `error` | string | No | Error if any occurred during the execution of the action |
| `successful` | boolean | Yes | Whether or not the action execution was successful or not |

### Search all content

**Slug:** `SLACK_SEARCH_ALL`

Tool to search all messages and files. Use when you need unified content search across channels and files in one call. Results are scoped to content visible to the authenticated token; missing hits in private or restricted channels reflect permission/membership gaps. Response separates messages and files into distinct sections — explicitly read the files section for document results. Results are index-based and may lag several minutes behind real-time; use SLACK_FETCH_CONVERSATION_HISTORY for near-real-time per-channel coverage. Paginated searches exceeding ~1 req/sec may return HTTP 429 too_many_requests; honor the Retry-After header and resume from the last page.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `page` | integer | No | Page number of results to return; default is 1. Iterate until total_count or page_count signals completion. |
| `sort` | string | No | Sort by `score` (relevance) or `timestamp` (chronological). |
| `count` | integer | No | Number of results per page; default is 20; max is 100. |
| `query` | string | Yes | Search query supporting Slack search modifiers/booleans. Date modifiers after:, before:, on: are UTC day-based; after: is exclusive, so convert time ranges to explicit UTC dates to avoid boundary gaps — sub-day precision requires client-side filtering by numeric ts. Spaces act as logical AND; omitting in:#channel or date filters makes search workspace-wide and slow. Malformed modifiers (e.g., wrong from: format) silently return zero results. |
| `team_id` | string | No | Encoded team ID to search in; required when using an org-level token. |
| `sort_dir` | string | No | Sort direction: `asc` or `desc`. |
| `highlight` | boolean | No | If true, search terms are wrapped with markers for client-side highlighting. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `data` | object | Yes | Data from the action execution |
| `error` | string | No | Error if any occurred during the execution of the action |
| `successful` | boolean | Yes | Whether or not the action execution was successful or not |

### Search messages

**Slug:** `SLACK_SEARCH_MESSAGES`

| `page` | integer | No | Page number for manual pagination control. Cannot be used with auto_paginate - choose either automatic collection OR manual page control, not both. |
| `sort` | string | No | Sort results by `score` (relevance) or `timestamp` (chronological). |

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | No | The message text to display. Required unless 'blocks' or 'attachments' is provided. When using blocks, this serves as fallback text for notifications. Supports markdown formatting. |
| `user` | string | Yes | User ID of the user to send the ephemeral message to. |
| `parse` | string | No | Controls text parsing behavior. Use 'full' to enable automatic linking of @mentions, #channels, and URLs. Use 'none' to disable special parsing (URLs will still be clickable). Defaults to 'none'. |
| `blocks` | string | No | A JSON-based array of structured blocks, presented as a URL-encoded string. |
| `as_user` | boolean | No | Legacy parameter for authenticated user authorship. Defaults to true without chat:write:bot scope, false otherwise. Setting to true requires chat:write:user scope for the authenticated user to author the message. |

| `link_names` | boolean | No | Find and link channel names and usernames. |
| `attachments` | string | No | This is Slack's legacy 'secondary attachments' field for adding rich formatting elements like colored sidebars, structured fields, and author info. Pass as a JSON string array. NOT for file/image uploads. To send files or images, use 'SLACK_UPLOAD_OR_CREATE_A_FILE_IN_SLACK' instead. |
| `markdown_text` | string | No | PREFERRED: Write your ephemeral message in markdown for nicely formatted display. Supports: headers (# ## ###), bold (**text** or __text__), italic (*text* or _text_), strikethrough (~~text~~), inline code (`code`), code blocks (```), links ([text](url)), block quotes (>), lists (- item, 1. item), dividers (--- or ***). IMPORTANT: Use \n for line breaks (e.g., 'Line 1\nLine 2'), not actual newlines. Incompatible with blocks or text parameters. Maximum 12,000 characters. |

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | No | Content of the 'me message', displayed as an action performed by the user (e.g., if text is 'is feeling happy', it appears as '*User is feeling happy*'). |
| `channel` | string | No | Specifies the target channel by its public ID (e.g., 'C1234567890'), private group ID, IM channel ID, or name (e.g., '#general', '@username'). |

| `data` | object | Yes | Data from the action execution |
| `error` | string | No | Error if any occurred during the execution of the action |

### Send message

**Slug:** `SLACK_SEND_MESSAGE`

Posts a message to a Slack channel, DM, or private group; requires at least one content field (`markdown_text`, `text`, `blocks`, or `attachments`) — omitting all causes a `no_text` error. Fails with `not_in_channel`, `channel_not_found`, or `channel_is_archived` if the bot lacks access. Body limit ~4000 characters. Rate-limited at ~1 req/sec (HTTP 429, honor `Retry-After`). Not idempotent — duplicate calls post duplicate messages.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | string | No | DEPRECATED: This sends raw text only, use markdown_text field. Primary textual content. Recommended fallback if using `blocks` or `attachments`. Supports mrkdwn unless `mrkdwn` is `false`. |
| `parse` | string | No | Message text parsing behavior. Set to 'full' to parse as user-typed (auto-links @mentions, #channels). Omit for default behavior (no special parsing). |
| `blocks` | string | No | DEPRECATED: Use `markdown_text` field instead. Block Kit layout blocks for rich/interactive messages. Accepts either a URL-encoded JSON string or a list of block dictionaries. See Slack API Block Kit docs for structure. |
| `mrkdwn` | boolean | No | Controls Slack mrkdwn formatting for the top-level `text` field ONLY. Set to `false` to disable formatting (text appears as-is with literal asterisks, underscores, etc.). Default `true` enables mrkdwn formatting (*bold*, _italic_, etc.). NOTE: This parameter has NO effect on `blocks` or `markdown_text` - block content always uses its own formatting rules. |
| `channel` | string | Yes | ID or name of the channel, private group, or IM channel to send the message to. Can be specified as either 'channel' or 'channel_id'. Do NOT include the '#' prefix (e.g., use 'general' not '#general') - any leading '#' will be automatically stripped. For DMs, use the channel ID returned by SLACK_OPEN_DM (starts with 'D'); usernames, emails, and user IDs are not valid DM targets. |
| `thread_ts` | string | No | Timestamp (`ts`) of an existing message to make this a threaded reply. Use `ts` of the parent message, not another reply. Example: '1476746824.000004'. |
| `link_names` | boolean | No | Automatically hyperlink channel names (e.g., #channel) and usernames (e.g., @user) in message text. Defaults to `false` for bot messages. |
| `attachments` | string | No | This is Slack's legacy 'secondary attachments' field for adding rich formatting elements like colored sidebars, structured fields, and author info to messages. Pass as a JSON string array. NOT for file/image uploads. To send a message with attachments of files or images, use the 'SLACK_UPLOAD_OR_CREATE_A_FILE_IN_SLACK' instead. |
| `unfurl_links` | boolean | No | Enable unfurling of text-based URLs. Defaults `false` for bots, `true` if `as_user` is `true`. |
| `unfurl_media` | boolean | No | Enable media previews (images, videos) from URLs. Set to `true` (default) to show media previews, `false` to hide them. |
| `markdown_text` | string | No | PREFERRED: Write your message in markdown for nicely formatted display. Supports: headers (# ## ###), bold (**text** or __text__), italic (*text* or _text_), strikethrough (~~text~~), inline code (`code`), code blocks (```), links ([text](url)), block quotes (>), lists (- item, 1. item), dividers (--- or ***), context blocks (:::context with images), and section buttons (:::section-button). IMPORTANT: Use \n for line breaks (e.g., 'Line 1\nLine 2'), not actual newlines. USER MENTIONS: To tag users, use their user ID with <@USER_ID> format (e.g., <@U1234567890>), not username. NOTE: Slack enforces a 50-block limit per message. Very long messages with extensive formatting may exceed this limit. If your message is very long, consider splitting it into multiple shorter messages or using simpler formatting. |
| `reply_broadcast` | boolean | No | If `true` for a threaded reply, also posts to main channel. Defaults to `false`. |
